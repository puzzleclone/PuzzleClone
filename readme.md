## üìã Overview

**PuzzleClone** is a data synthesis framework and comprehensive dataset for logical reasoning problems. It features:
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed Verifiability:** Every problem is generated with a ground-truth solution and is verifiable by a symbolic SMT solver, ensuring correctness.
- üéØ **Granular Control:** Offers fine-grained control over problem attributes like scale, structure, and difficulty through a set of adjustable parameters, enabling large-scale batch generation.
- ‚ú® **Flexible Adaptation:** Facilitates the easy customization of problem scenarios and translation into different languages or domains.
- üìä **Expansive and Diverse Coverage:** Based on PuzzleClone, we have curated a [benchmark](https://github.com/puzzleClone/PuzzleCloneData/) including 83,657 unique logical reasoning puzzles procedurally generated from 86 seed questions. The dataset spans:
  - Various applications of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and SMT-like puzzles,
  - Classic logical puzzles like Sudoku, the Knapsack problem, and linear optimization (LP).
  - Diverse mathematical problems of varying difficulties.
- üöÄ **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieves SOTA results among open-source datasets, outperforming the public dataset by 12.5 points on AMC2023 (from 52.5 to 65.0).

## üöÄ Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/puzzleclone/PuzzleClone.git
cd PuzzleClone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are a few common use cases.

### Generate a single test case for debugging
This runs the translator in test mode (`-t`), generating a sample question based on the specification file.
```
python translator.py -t cases/graduation/spec.json
```

### Generate a full dataset for production
This runs the translator in production mode (`-d`) to generate a large number of problems and saves them to a specified output file (`-o`).
```
python translator.py -d cases/graduation/spec.json -o data.jsonl
```

### Apply a new template to existing data
This uses the `-g` flag to load existing problem data and applies a new problem description or template (`new_spec.json`) to it.
```
python translator.py -d cases/graduation/new_spec.json -g old_data.jsonl -o new_data.jsonl
```
